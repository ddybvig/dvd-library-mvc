## DVD Library Console App
This was the first MVC application I made. It is a Maven project that I wrote in NetBeans. It lets the user add, update, or delete DVDs
through console input. The user can also view one or all DVDs in the library. The library is contained in library.txt,
which is written to and read from in the DAO.
