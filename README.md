## DVD Library Console App
This was the first MVC application I made. It lets the user add, update, or delete DVDs
through console input. The user can also view one or all DVDs in the library. The library is contained in library.txt,
which is written to and read from in the DAO.

As far as running it goes, this was built in NetBeans using Maven. If you have an IDE that compiles JVM code you 
should be able to run it.
